Final app for making a ToDoList App for the iPhone

This is the final implementation of the iPhone application shown in the demo for iOS App in a nutshell presentation.

The Application:
1. Allows users to pass data from rootViewController to detailViewController
2. Allows users to add data to the rootViewController using addViewController


Challenge: The tableView is NOT implemented with a delete row functionality. Implement an Edit button on the navigationBar to edit rows on the tableView and update it.
